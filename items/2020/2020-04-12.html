    <p>Update: <strong>12 April 2020</strong></p>
    <p>Another week of lockdown and more time on my hands. This week I have been working on house-keeping my GEDCOM file. With help from <a href="https://chronoplexsoftware.com/gedcomvalidator/">GEDCOM Validator</a>, I have been able to strip out errors from <a href="https://www.simonarthur.co.uk/family/tree/">my family tree</a> data file. A lot of the errors were caused by my own input and invalid entry types. Now we have a valid GEDCOM that meets the Best Practice standards. I'm still looking for the best method of naming media files (photographs, certificates, census returns, etc) that allows for groups of individuals. Most guidance is for single photographs which is not much help really.</p>
