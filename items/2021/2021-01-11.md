Redesigned for Markdown
=======================

A lot of the time when I'm taking notes for work I just type them down in [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) language.  Markdown is a simple and easy-to-use markup language you can use to format virtually any document but, unlike [HTML](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/htmlcss), it also maintains the human readability of the document.  If you need Markdown to perform extra functions you can embed HTML, CSS and JavaScript directly into the document.

Notepad++ has a plug-in specifically developed for viewing and outputting Markdown, conveniently called [MarkdownViewer++](https://github.com/nea/MarkdownViewerPlusPlus).

I decided to rewrite this site using Markdown at the core.  It allows me to write documents concentrating on the content rather than the presentation.  I have added a few simple CSS attributes to the plug-in, but most of the style will be from the browsers in-built style.

Markdown is also well supported by [Github](https://github.com/) and many other [static site generators](https://jamstack.org/generators/).

You can view the [Markdown Version](./2021-01-11.md) of this page.
