Using the tools available to me for free on the web, and family contacts, I have started to develop a page or two dedicated to the ARTHUR-EARL family tree. Obviously I will start with myself and the girls and work outwards.

Progress is slow but [you can view the latest version of the ARTHUR tree](https://www.simonarthur.co.uk/family/tree/surnames.htm) in HTML format thanks to [Ged2Web](http://www.wtoram.co.uk/ged2web/ged2web.htm). If anyone thinks they can contribute to my efforts, or they spot an error or omission, please email <genealogy@simonarthur.co.uk> with the subject line '_Genealogy_'. I will gladly review any submissions.
