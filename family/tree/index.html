    <p>Using the tools available to me for free on the web, and family contacts, I have started to develop a page or two dedicated to the ARTHUR-EARL family tree. Obviously I will start with myself and the girls and work outwards.</p>
    <p>Progress is slow but <a href="https://www.simonarthur.co.uk/family/tree/surnames.htm">you can view the latest version of the ARTHUR tree</a> in HTML format thanks to <a href="http://www.wtoram.co.uk/ged2web/ged2web.htm">Ged2Web</a>. If anyone thinks they can contribute to my efforts, or they spot an error or omission, please email <a href="mailto:genealogy@simonarthur.co.uk">genealogy@simonarthur.co.uk</a> with the subject line '<em>Genealogy</em>'. I will gladly review any submissions.</p>
