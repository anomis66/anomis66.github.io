    <p>Updated: <strong>2 January 2021</strong></p>
    <p>The main purpose of this site is as a learning platform.  When I have time, I play around with simple technonlogies and publish bits and pieces that I have found interesting or useful.  Published items will come and go over time as they are needed.</p>
    <p>I also have a small blog and <a href="/family/tree/">my family tree</a> research held here.</p>
