Keep It Simple, Simon
========================

Updated: **2 January 2021**

The main purpose of this site is as a learning platform.  When I have time, I play around with simple technologies and publish [bits and pieces](/items/) that I have found interesting or useful.  Published items will come and go over time as they are needed.  

I also have [my family tree research](/family/tree/) held here.
